# CS 300 README Journal


### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The Problem I was attempting to solve with the projects for this course was how to properly build a data structure for a course registration system.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached the problem through first creating different pseudocode for some of the most common data structures implemented today. From there
I created a runtime analysis in order to determine the best structure for the job and then implemented the one I believed to be strongest. I think that data
structures are important to understand as most programs in our world today implement some form of them, and each program will have a different set of needs
that must be properly analyzed in order to gain speed and efficiency.
