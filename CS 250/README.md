#### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Some ways to interpret user needs are by speaking directly to the users themselves and simply taking notes on what they talk about and the frequency of feature mentions. Users tend to speak more about things they're adamant about in a program. These can then be transformed into user stories, which are specific tasks a program allows a user to complete. These user stories then guide developers on their programming to ensure the users needs as emphasized are implemented properly and effectively.

#### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I tend to approach developing programs in an iterative way. Personally I just enjoy seeing immediate progress on anything, so building small functional features and then piecing them together at the end is just a more rewarding and effective way of programming. Going forward I hope to implement better sprint planning as even though I enjoy iterative programming, I tend to also have a “just one more feature” mindset that causes my sprints to last way too long.

#### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think that being a good team member in software development hinges on two main factors, first, your professionality which can be defined as your openness to interact with others in a non-judgemental way, and second, high knowledge of your own skill set. What I mean by that second part is the ability to understand what you are good or bad and work from there with your team. Under-selling yourself on certain aspects can harm the team by giving someone a job they may be less effective at, and on the other side of the spectrum, overselling yourself will lead to inefficiency on your end. All in all, it’s just important to be communicative with your team and act as a person who others are comfortable around.
