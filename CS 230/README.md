# The Gaming Room (CS 230 Project)

#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a digital game studio who ran online web based games. As a client, they wanted us to design their project “Draw It or Lose It”, which was a fully online web based game that would allow multiple players to join a room and take turns drawing or guessing what is being drawn for several rounds.

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Personally I believe that I did a great job with the executive summary portion of the documentation. I felt as though the points I gave were succinct and informative and really gave the client and understanding of what was being built.

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Personally I found the domain model to be the most helpful in working with code as it truly gave me a visual layout on how to create the game, player, and team objects as well as understand how they interacted with one another. It also, being a UML, was immensely easy to transfer directly over into code.

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would redo the evaluation portion of the documentation. Just looking back over it I feel as though I could have better explained the Client Side implementation of the project as it read a little too vague at points.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the users' needs by looking at the documentation provided by The Gaming Room. They gave information on what their users enjoyed and would respond best to so I simply translated that into the design documentation. It is important to consider the users’ needs when designing as even if a piece of tech is fully operational and technologically advanced, if a user has no need to use it, then it's not a helpful or even useful piece of software. 

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the software through a more critical and technical lens, looking very intensely at the specifics of what I was using to craft my design. I think going forward I am going to apply more of a filter to the way that I present more technical information, especially when it comes to memory and security terminology, as I feel as though with a real client I would have lost them in tech talk early on which would not be good.
